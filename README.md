# Clock-Timer-
Clock Timer for 8 Bit CPU.

Clock timer circuit that has the capability to swap between an astable pulse and a manual pulse with a select switch, and a halt to stop button.
My code includes wires from the manual and astable inputs to two leds to show a side by side of the timer, these may or may not be included depending on the available i/o's on the basys - 3 board.
